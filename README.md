Acne plays a very important role in medical diagnoses and treatment for patients with skin problems.However, it remains challenging to diagnose acne based on the facial images of patients due to the complex and subtle nature of context or feature

Here,I am using a Deep learning-CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). and concept of transfer learning which can detect the probability of having Acne in the Face. Please go throw my codes 

I would like to know your opinion on how I can improve my future works. Enjoy reading! and Happy Learning.!
